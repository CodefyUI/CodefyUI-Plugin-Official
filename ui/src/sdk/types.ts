 * `GET /api/runs/{id}/events` pages by and `runs.get(id).last_cursor` reports.
 * Use it to line an event up against the REST side. It is strictly increasing
 * within a run but **not dense**: the log also holds entries this stream does
 * not publish (artifacts, run warnings, refused submits, entries the server
 * collapsed because they were too large), and each of those consumes a cursor.
 * A cursor jump is therefore ordinary — a run that saves a checkpoint produces
 * one every time — and says nothing about whether you missed anything.
 *
 * `seq` is this stream's own counter, and it is the one to check for loss. It
 * counts the events delivered to plugin subscribers for a run, densely: the
 * next event you receive for a run always has `seq` exactly one higher than
 * the last, unless the host dropped events under the buffering limit. So
 * `seq` gapless means you have everything; `seq` jumping by N means N events
 * were dropped and `runs.metrics()` is how to recover them.
 *
 * (The first `seq` you see for a run is your baseline, not necessarily 1: it
 * counts from when the editor started streaming that run, which may predate
 * your subscription.)
 *
 * A `metric` entry carries the whole batch it was recorded as, rather than
 * being split into one event per point. That keeps the log entry atomic —
 * `cursor` would otherwise say "you have this entry" when only part of it had
 * been delivered — and makes `points` the SAME type `runs.metrics()` returns,
 * so a dashboard can fold the live tail and the REST back-fill with one
 * function. `value` is `null` for a non-finite number exactly as it is there.
 *
 * Events and their `points` are frozen: they are shared between every
 * subscriber, so one plugin cannot mutate what another receives.
